A repository dedicated to visualizing and preprocessing agricultural data at the district level (ICRISAT dataset) using Python and data analysis techniques. The primary tool is a Jupyter Notebook that walks through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization steps.

---

### Repository Contents

* `ICRISAT-District Level Data.csv` : Raw dataset—likely includes district-level agricultural metrics from ICRISAT.
* `crops.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook that explores and visualizes the data. It likely covers data loading, cleaning, transformation, and generating insightful visualizations.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.7+
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Common data science libraries, e.g.:

  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
  ```

#### Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aastha280/Data-Visualization-and-Pre-processing.git
   cd Data-Visualization-and-Pre-processing
   ```
2. Open and run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook crops.ipynb
   ```
3. Walk through the notebook to see:

   * Loading and exploring the dataset
   * Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
   * Visualizations like charts, plots, and maps to reveal trends or insights

### Notebook Overview (`crops.ipynb`)

The Jupyter Notebook typically includes:

* **Data Loading** – Reading the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Generating summary stats and checking for missing values or anomalies.
* **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing or erroneous entries, type conversions, etc.
* **Preprocessing** – Scaling, normalizing, or encoding where necessary.
* **Visualizations** – Charts and plots (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, etc.) to understand trends across districts, crops, seasons, etc.
* **Conclusions & Insights** – Key findings from the data shown through visuals and analysis.

---

### Customization & Extension Ideas

* **Add More Visualizations** – Use interactive plotting libraries like Plotly or Folium for maps.
* **Compute Derived Metrics** – Per-district averages, seasonal comparisons, yield forecasts, etc.
* **Modularize Code** – Refactor logic into standalone `.py` scripts for clean reuse.
* **Documentation** – Expand explanations in markdown cells, add a badges section, or link to key findings.
